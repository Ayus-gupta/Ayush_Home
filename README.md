## 📘 Description
This project reimagines astrology through the lens of data and reason. Instead of relying on stars and signs, it focuses on real-world data, individual priorities, and behavioral similarities to predict possible futures.

At its heart is a simple yet powerful belief:
"Priorities shape destiny. Those who choose faster grow faster."

By analyzing what people value, how they decide, and what paths they follow, the system draws logical parallels between individuals — offering predictive insights not from the stars but from patterns grounded in reality.

# Into Imagination - Vue App

This is a creative multi-room Vue.js application inspired by the storytelling web series **"Into Imagination"**. Each virtual roomâ€”Kitchen, My Room, TV Room, and Secret Roomâ€”offers a unique interaction inspired by stories, food, music, secrets, and user imagination.

## ðŸŒŸ Application Concept

The app presents the **imaginative world of a boy named Ayush**, who explores books and experiences stories in different dimensions. Each room reflects his imagination:

- **Kitchen Room**: Recipe suggestions & reviews.
- **My Room**: Books, music, and user story requests.
- **TV Room**: For watching & imagining scenes from stories.
- **Secret Room**: A safe space for sharing innocent secrets and imagination prompts.

The navigation simulates movement between parts of Ayushâ€™s mind.

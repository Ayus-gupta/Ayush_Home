# 🌐 Similara {Prioritology.com}

## 📘 Description
This project reimagines astrology through the lens of data and reason. Instead of relying on stars and signs, it focuses on real-world data, individual priorities, and behavioral similarities to predict possible futures.

At its heart is a simple yet powerful belief:
"Priorities shape destiny. Those who choose faster grow faster."

By comparing user-defined priorities and analyzing behavioral similarity, the system offers insights grounded in logic — not birth charts or personality labels.

## 🚀 Features
- Predict The Future On basic of resoning and logic with real-world situations.
- Meet yourself.
- Astrology with Science.
